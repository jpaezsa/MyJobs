    """
    Determines if the currently logged in user should be accessing the
    decorated view

    Expects that the url contains a captured `user_email` parameter that is
    not vital to view functionality; This is removed from the view's kwargs
    and is not passed to the view itself.

    Throws KeyError if email is not provided. This is an indicator of two
    things:
    - Using this decorator may not be necessary
    - If using this decorator really is desired, the url pattern may not be
        set up correctly

    Inputs:
    :model: Optional; Model class that the user is trying to access
    :pk_name: Optional; Name of the id parameter being passed to
        the decorated view

    Outputs:
    :response: Http404 or the results of running the decorated view
